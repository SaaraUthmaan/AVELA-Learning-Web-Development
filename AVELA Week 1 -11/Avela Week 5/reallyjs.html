<h2>Plastic Surgery</h2>

<p>Last week I embarked on a self discovery journey, there I learned that change must be achieved in order for me to succed in life. 
    I decided to take drastic measures and tranform who I am from inside out. My 
    first stop was to my bestfriend's work place, Worchester's Surgery.

    <img id="me" src="girl.jpeg" alt="Before Surgery">

<p id="remake"></p>
<img id="remake" src="richgirl.jpeg" alt="After Surgery">

<script>
// I say this to create an object
const me= {type:"Tall",  backgroundColor:"poor", color:"black"};
//I can change the properties but I cant change the object.
me.color = "white";
me.backgroundColor = "rich";
me.type = "short";
</script>
<script>
// Display the property and show my Transformation
document.getElementById("me").innerHTML = "This was me before I left: I was a black girl from an unfortunate background, that towered over whoever she met. However, I slouched to avoid the stares.";
document.getElementById("me").src="girl.jpeg";

document.getElementById("remake").innerHTML = "As I exited the hospital, I felt empowered and transformed, finally I had broken free of the shell of my skin. I thought, finally, I will also have oppurtunties to succeed. Gone was the black girl, in her spot stood, a " + " " + me.backgroundColor + " " +
 "blond girl" + " " + " " + "who lucky inherited her dead parents money appeared.";
</script>
<p>I continued on with my life, happy about the change I made until I came across the suddenly fashion trends that represented black people. 
    Suddenly, black people were it and I wanted to who I was in the past. I ran to the hospital to reconnect with my friend who did my surgery.
    However, to my everlastiing regert surgeries to change skin color were no longer proceeded with since the serum to active the change was lost.
</p>
<p>This discovery made me startle away from my sleep, I awoke taking a shakey breathe and looked at my sweat soaked skin,black. I breathed a sigh of releif happy that I didn't chnage who I am on the outside.
    I threw the blanket aside and began my day with the goal of chnaging who I am in the inside so I could be successful. </p>
